Before you begin you'll need Postgres installed and running

`brew install postgres` and follow the prompt to start it. `brew start services postgres` if it gets stopped for whatever reason.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
